# Hi everyone, I am Simone Di Gregorio ✌️

## About me
I hold a bachelor's degree in [Management and Computer Science](https://www.luiss.it/ammissione/offerta-formativa/laurea-triennale/management-computer-science) from LUISS and I am currently a student of the [Data Science master's degree](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) @Sapienza. 

Through university and (a lot of) self-studying I have a solid background in data science, from simple ETL to modelling. In particular, I have in-depth knowledge of: 
- R for machine learning, modelling, statistics, reporting (R Markdown) and data manipulation, exploiting the tidyverse ecosystem far more than the base language.
- Python for scripting, manipulation, modelling and web scraping. Specifically, my experience revolves mostly around Pandas, NumPy, scikit and Tensorflow.  Experience with Tensorflow has been both with Keras and more low-level APIs.
- [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform) and [KNIME Server](https://www.knime.com/knime-business-hub), now Business Hub, due to [university projects](https://hub.knime.com/simonedigreg/spaces/Public/latest/FinalProjectMKT/Workflow%20Final%20Challenge~mEkn8g_JscCIzb3i) and work experience. Specifically, I am [L1, L2 and L3](https://www.knime.com/blog/certification-program-updates-for-users) certified.
- Relational paradigm for databases and SQL.

I am a former Data Science Intern @[KNIME](https://www.knime.com), the software company behind KNIME Analytics Platform (and its enterprise version), a popular and powerful low-code tool to perform data science tasks, at every level. As an employee, I developed KNIME native low-code approaches for the Word2Vec complete pipeline and I also developed a fast new Python-based Word2Vec node based on Tensorflow, using a mix of low-level APIs (mainly for the pre-processing) and Keras for the modelling steps. The code for the node is publicly available in one of my repositories, at [this link](https://github.com/sim2000dg/Word2VecPyNodeTF).

I am also a Teaching Assistant in Statistical Methods for Data Science and Laboratory, one of the main courses, spanning two semesters, 
in the Data Science Master’s Degree @Sapienza, dealing with an introduction to Probability Theory before delving into Frequentist and Bayesian Inference.
